# SCAAI Problem Statement 3: 
Develop an image processing model to classify the type of disaster based on the
image dataset.

# Overview

This is my TensorFlow implementation of the problem statement given to me by members of SCAAI 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7
- [Tensorflow 2 ](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Running the Running the notebook
- The notebook provided with the solution named ```train.ipynb``` contains all the code required to train the model from scratch.

-  The notebook is fully supported by Google Colab out of the box as well but is originally created and trained on my local machine.
